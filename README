[EIREXE'S custom source engine model repro (actually not source, but everything).]

[Actual Projects]
.-Sunny [Metal gear rising]
.--See TODO in /sunny folder.

[Tips]
So here we are, i'm going to be fast here, if you work on something make sure it compiles into a working model.
Then just commit it.
If it doesn't work but it's a wip or you need help commit it as a new .max file

[Don't want to use git]
If you don't want to use git email your changes at eirexe123@gmail.com and i'll take a look and commit them for you.
